It is used by the Linux Kernel and a huge amount\n+      of open source projects.\n+      Get it at http://git-scm.com/download\n+\n+ d) Github Account (Optional)\n+      If you plan to adjust the module and want your changes to be\n+      integrated, you'll need a Github Account. A free Account\n+      will do just fine, get it at\n+      https://github.com/signup/free\n+\n+ Building the Plugin:\n+ --------------------\n+\n+1. Create a workspace for Arquillian, e.g.\n+    /home/yourUsername/work/resin\n+\n+   In Linux/MacOSX, open a shell and navigate to this directory by entering\n+\n+   cd /home/yourUsername/work/resin\n+\n+2. Checkout the Arquillian \"Core\" Module\n+   git clone git://github.com/arquillian/arquillian-core.git\n+\n+3. Build the Arquillian BOM\n+\n+   1) Change to the correct directory\n+        cd /home/yourUsername/work/resin/arquillian-core/bom/\n+   2) Switch to the correct tag\n+        git checkout 1.0.0.Beta1\n+   3) Install the \"BOM\"\n+        mvn clean compile install\n+      (Note: This might take a while as \"maven is downloading the internet\" ;) )\n+\n+4. Checkout Caucho's Aruillian Repository\n+\n+    You have to differentiate here if you would like to adjust the source code of the\n+    module (a) or just want to build it (b).\n+\n+    a) If you want to adjust the code and get your changes upstream, do the following:\n+        Fork & Clone Caucho's Arquillian Repo\n+            - Go to https://github.com/caucho/arquillian-container-resin\n+            - Click the fork button on the top right of the page\n+            - Clone your own fork by doing the following\n+                cd /home/yourUsername/work/resin\n+                git clone git@github.com:/yourGithubUsername/arquillian-container-resin\n+                cd arquillian-container-resin\n+            - continue with step 5\n+    b) If you just want to build the module yourself\n+        Clone Caucho's Arquillian Repo\n+            cd /home/yourUsername/work/resin\n+            git clone git://github.com/caucho/arquillian-container-resin.git\n+            cd arquillian-container-resin\n+\n+5. Build the module\n+    You should be in the directory\n+        /home/yourUsername/work/resin/arquillian-container-resin\n+    Now type to build and install the module\n+        mvn clean compile install\n+    As we're probably in the middle of a dvelopment cycle, your build might not\n+    complete successfully, then you'll have to reset your codebase to a solid\n+    state.\n+    To get a list of all tagged states, type\n+        git tag -l\n+    Choose a tag by typing\n+        git checkout <tagname>\n+        e.g. git checkout 1.0.0.Beta1\n+","filename":"README"}],"committer":{"login":"aslakknutsen","name":"Aslak Knutsen","email":"aslak@redhat.com"},"committed_date":"2012-02-22T08:37:10-08:00","authored_date":"2011-06-03T07:16:42-07:00"}}
